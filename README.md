# t9Pad

Part of the curicculum of the MSc

This is a project for using tree data structures and binary search to create a T9 predictive text system, resembling the keypad of the older mobile phones.

Different data structures and searching algorithms were used to finalise this application.

The GUI was created using Swing.
